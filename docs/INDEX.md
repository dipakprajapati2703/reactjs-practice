## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

### **Step 0: ES6+ JavaScript Essentials** 
📁 [step-0-es6.md](./step-0-es6.md)

**What you'll learn:**
- Block-scoped variables (`let`, `const`)
- Arrow functions and lexical `this`
- Template literals and string interpolation
- Destructuring (objects and arrays)
- Spread and rest operators
- Default parameters
- Modern array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- ES modules (`import`/`export`)
- Promises and async/await

**Why it matters:**
- ES6+ features make React components cleaner and safer
- Encourages immutable updates for predictable re-renders
- Keeps components small and reusable

**Practice in the app:**
- Visit `/es6-examples` route
- Experiment with different inputs
- Rewrite helpers using destructuring and spread

---

### **Step 1: React Props**
📁 [step-1-props.md](./step-1-props.md)

**What you'll learn:**
- Props as component inputs
- Read-only nature of props
- Passing data down and handlers up
- Using `props.children` for composition
- Default values and prop validation
- Avoiding prop drilling with Context

**Why it matters:**
- Encapsulation and reuse with explicit data flow
- Clear boundaries between parent and child responsibilities
- Encourages composition over inheritance

**Practice in the app:**
- Visit `/props-example` route
- Add new visual props to components
- Replace hard-coded values with props
- Compose layouts using `props.children`

---

### **Step 2: React State**
📁 [step-2-state.md](./step-2-state.md)

**What you'll learn:**
- Local component state with `useState`
- State as component memory
- Immutable updates and functional updates
- State lifting between components
- Derived values vs stored state
- State preservation and reset behavior

**Why it matters:**
- Declarative UI that recalculates based on state
- Immutable updates reduce bugs
- Pairs naturally with props and lifted state

**Practice in the app:**
- Create `/state-examples` route (planned)
- Implement counters, toggles, and forms
- Practice immutable object and array updates
- Experiment with state lifting
