# ðŸ“š Learning Examples

This directory contains step-by-step learning examples for mastering React development concepts.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Inside

### **Step-by-Step Learning Path**
Each file represents a progressive learning step, building from JavaScript fundamentals to React concepts:

1. **[step-0-es6.md](./step-0-es6.md)** - ES6+ JavaScript Essentials
   - Modern JavaScript features essential for React
   - Block-scoped variables, arrow functions, destructuring
   - Template literals, spread/rest operators, array methods
   - ES modules, promises, and async/await

2. **[step-1-props.md](./step-1-props.md)** - React Props Fundamentals
   - Component inputs and data flow
   - Read-only nature of props
   - Using `props.children` for composition
   - Avoiding prop drilling with Context

3. **[step-2-state.md](./step-2-state.md)** - React State Management
   - Local component state with useState
   - Immutable updates and functional updates
   - State lifting between components
   - State preservation and reset behavior

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### **Learning Order**
1. **Start with Step 0** - Master ES6+ JavaScript fundamentals
2. **Progress to Step 1** - Learn React props and component communication
3. **Complete with Step 2** - Understand React state management

### **Practice Approach**
- **Read the theory** in each step file
- **Follow the practice checklists** provided
- **Experiment with the examples** in the live application
- **Apply concepts** to build your own components

### **Live Examples**
Each step corresponds to routes in the application:
- **Step 0**: Visit `/es6-examples` route
- **Step 1**: Visit `/props-example` route
- **Step 2**: Create `/state-examples` route (planned)

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Tips

### **Best Practices**
- **Don't rush** - Take time to understand each concept
- **Practice actively** - Don't just read, experiment with code
- **Build incrementally** - Add features step by step
- **Review and refactor** - Improve your code as you learn

### **Success Metrics**
- **Code comprehension** - Understand what each line does
- **Problem solving** - Can implement new features independently
- **Code quality** - Write clean, maintainable code
- **Debugging skills** - Can identify and fix issues

## ðŸ”® Future Steps

Planned additional learning examples:
- **Custom Hooks** - Reusable logic extraction
- **Context API** - Global state management
- **Performance** - Optimization techniques
- **Testing** - Unit and integration testing
- **Advanced Patterns** - HOCs, render props, etc.
